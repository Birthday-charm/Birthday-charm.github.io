				<h2>About You</h2>
				<div class="mb_content_inner">
					<p>Happy first year anniversary to my one and only princess, I hope that in this year of love you will always paint smile in your lips. I may not be exactly the reason of that happiness but the important thing is that you are happy. I want you to know that I would never get tired of saying these 3 magic words 'I LOVE YOU'. I couldn’t imagine living in this world without you and your love. You're my world, my life, and everything. We have faced lots of problems but I won’t believe this would break both of us for I know that only love which would bind us and make us stronger. Sorry for I am not a perfect boyfriend you ever wished to have but I would strive to be the best not for perfection. Thanks for stepping into my life and became part of my chaotic world. You know how you change my life. Thanks for accepting me for who really I am and who I could ever be. Thank you for not giving up on me. We may sometimes hurt each other’s feeling but you are still there and I would always be there for you. Thank u for making me realized how beautiful life is, and that I won’t just stop there but would still go on. Thank you for cheering me up when I'm down. Thank you for understanding my flaws and mistakes. There would always be words I'll always say, please don’t change because I love the way you took good care of me, the way you value me and the way you show how important I am to you. I promise to love you and only you until my last breath.</p>
					<p> You are my perfect match, you are always there to pick me up when I am down, you always knows how to put a smile on my face and gives me the motivation to continue to try and be the best I can. I honestly never thought I would get so lucky but I guess there's always a surprise waiting for you to make you want to be better, not just for other people but for yourself. Thank you for helping me grow In confidence, to push me to success, and to still want to continue moving forward every day no matter how tough the day can be. I love you.</p>
					<p> You have always been my biggest supporter and fan. You've always had my back and in your eyes, I can do nothing wrong which has built my confidence throughout my life. Thank you darling for loving me unconditionally and forever! You have made me the man I am today and I will always love you with all my heart. People say they would love to have a wife that would do anything for her husband. I have that in you and I appreciate all that you do and have always done in my life. You will be the love in my heart to eternity.</p>
					<p> I just want to take a minute to tell someone special how much he means to me. Babe,I love you with all my heart and I am very happy and appreciative of you and everything you have done for us. You make me feel so happy all the time. I thank God every day for leading me in your direction. You are a wonderful woman and I am proud to be your husband and to call you my wife! No one could ever take your place you have given me so much confidence and self-esteem I feel good about myself.You give me power and encouragement every second that goes by! I love you very much and I appreciate you very much! I love you, you are my world baby..</p>
